# Zend Framework 1.9.5, Doctrine 1.2 and ZFDebug

## The application structure is highly inspired by [Eric Leclerc's zfdebugdoctrine project](http://github.com/danceric/) and [Jon Lebensold's video cast on "Writing Doctrine Unit Tests with Zend_Test"](http://www.zendcasts.com/writing-doctrine-unit-tests-with-zend_test/2009/12/).

To try this demo project, please follow the instruction below by [Eric Leclerc](http://github.com/danceric/)

You need to put these libs in the `library` folder (or in your php include path)

- [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) 1.9.x
- [ZFDebug](http://code.google.com/p/zfdebug/) 1.5.x
- [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) (Doctrine AND vendor folder) 1.2.x

It should look like:

    library/
      Danceric/
      Doctrine/
      vendor/
      ZFDebug/
      Zend/
